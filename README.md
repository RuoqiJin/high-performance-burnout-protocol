# High-Performance Burnout Protocol 🧠⚡️

> **A Maintenance Manual for High-Intensity, High-Sensitivity Creative Brains.**
> For creators and developers whose brains run like Ferrari engines—but frequently face "fuel depletion" and "system crashes."

## 📖 Introduction

Have you experienced any of the following?

1. **Involuntary Flow:** Getting instantly "pulled" into an idea, your brain accelerating to 10,000 RPM with no way to brake on your own.
2. **Rapid Burnout:** After hours of intense creation, your energy cliff-drops and your body is utterly exhausted.
3. **Self-Attack Loop:** The moment burnout hits, your brain floods with self-deprecating thoughts ("I'm terrible," "I messed up")—even though just hours ago you felt invincible.

**You're not alone, and you're not broken.** You simply have a high-performance engine that shipped without a proper cooling system.

This repository isn't motivational fluff—it's an **engineering debugging log** and **maintenance manual**. It documents how to safely land this "expensive" machine before it overheats.

## 🎯 Target Audience (System Specs)

This guide is for **High-Intensity Neurotypes** with the following characteristics:

* **Professions:** Programmers, founders, artists, video editors, traders—anyone with high cognitive load.
* **Traits:**
  * **Low Latent Inhibition:** Your brain doesn't filter out stimuli like others do. You see connections everywhere—but can't turn it off.
  * **Hyperfocus-Prone:** You don't choose to enter flow; you get pulled in. It's not "good focus"—it's attention hijacking.
  * **Pulse Workers:** Ill-suited for 9-to-5. You work in intense 4-hour bursts, then crash. This is your normal.

## 🚩 Warning Flags

Before a "system crash," the body sends faint signals. **The "tired" signal is delayed**—when you feel it, you've already overdrafted. Learn to catch earlier warnings:

| Signal Type | Symptoms | Severity | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cognitive** | Re-reading lines, memory gaps, unusual typos | 🟡 Warning | Note time. ~30 min left. Start winding down. |
| **Physiological** | Sighing, cold hands/feet, tunnel vision | 🟠 Critical | **Stop now.** Glucose. 5-min break minimum. |
| **Emotional** | Rage at minor delays, sudden emptiness | 🔴 Error | **Emergency shutdown.** No decisions. See [Emergency Manual](docs/emergency-manual.md). |

**The most dangerous signal:** *"I'm fine, just 10 more minutes."* When this thought appears, you're already past warning.

## 🛠️ Quick Reference

### Emergency Hotfix (Brain Stalling)

```
Ramune (2-3 tablets, sublingual) → 10 min reboot
Diving Reflex (cold water on face) → Instant vagus nerve activation
Physiological Sigh (2 inhales + 1 long exhale) → Fastest cortisol reduction
```

### The 90-Minute Rule

```
90 min ON → 20 min OFF → Repeat
Timer is NON-NEGOTIABLE.
Even mid-brilliant-code, STOP.
```

### The Mantra

When self-attack thoughts appear:

> **"This is physiological noise—a dopamine crash—not reality. I felt invincible 3 hours ago. The only thing that changed is blood sugar."**

### What NOT To Do When Crashing

- ❌ Review your work (becomes self-criticism rally)
- ❌ Make decisions (risk assessment is broken)
- ❌ "Just 10 more minutes" (the lie that extends crashes)
- ❌ Use phone during "break" (not rest, just different drain)

## 🤝 Contributing

Every body is different. If you have your own "brain hacks," submit an **Issue** or **Pull Request**.

* Share your emergency snacks
* Share your interrupt mantras
* Share your early warning signals
* Share what works (and what doesn't)

This is N=1 research becoming N=many.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

*This repository constitutes qualitative self-research ("N-of-1 trial") and does not constitute medical advice.*

## 🔬 Why This Exists

Traditional neuroscience research happens in controlled lab environments. Scientists rarely observe high-intelligence, high-intensity creative workers under **real high-pressure conditions** over extended periods.

This repository provides qualitative data on:
- Flow induction mechanisms
- Specific thought patterns during burnout (the content of self-attacks)
- Specific interventions and their effectiveness (e.g., glucose intake timing)

Many great psychological discoveries (like Piaget's child development research) started from observing a few individuals closely. This summary may become the foundation for larger-scale quantitative research.
