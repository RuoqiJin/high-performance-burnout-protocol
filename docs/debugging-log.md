## Example Entry

## 📅 2025-01-15 Episode Log

### Context
- **Location:** Tokyo, home office
- **Sleep last night:** 5 hours
- **Last meal:** 4 hours ago
- **Hydration:** poor

### The Flow
- **Trigger:** Debugging a complex async race condition
- **Start time:** 14:00
- **Duration:** 4.5 hours
- **Type:** involuntary (couldn't stop)

### The Crash
- **Warning signs noticed:**
  - [x] Sighing
  - [x] Cold hands/feet
  - [ ] Tunnel vision
  - [x] Reading comprehension failing
  - [x] Memory gaps
  - [ ] Irritability spike

- **Self-attack content:**
  > "I'm mass-producing garbage. Nothing I do matters. I should have figured this out hours ago. Everyone else would have solved this already."

### Intervention
- **What I did:**
  - [x] Glucose (Ramune x3)
  - [x] Cold water/diving reflex
  - [x] Physiological sigh
  - [ ] NSDR/Yoga Nidra
  - [ ] Physical movement

- **Time to stabilize:** 15 minutes

### Notes
The sleep debt was definitely a factor. The self-attack thoughts felt completely real in the moment but looked absurd 20 minutes later. Ramune worked fast.
