# Nutrition Pack

> Fuel strategies for high-RPM brains. v1.0 (Tokyo Edition)

For your "Ferrari engine" brain, if you wait until the car is smoking (complete burnout) to stop, it's too late. You need a professional **"pit stop refueling"** and **"dashboard monitoring"** strategy.

## Part 1: Emergency Rescue — How to Quickly "Inject Fuel" into the Brain?

When you feel that moment of "brain suddenly can't turn, emotions starting to drop," it's because the brain's glucose is depleted. You need **monosaccharides (fast absorption)**.

### The Ramune Hack (Japan-Exclusive "Hacker Snack")

**Product:** Morinaga Large Ramune (森永大粒ラムネ)

This is a staple for many Japanese programmers and Tokyo University students.

- **Why:** The main ingredient is **90% glucose (ブドウ糖)**, not regular sucrose. Glucose can directly cross the blood-brain barrier and be instantly absorbed by the brain.
- **How to eat:** When feeling tired, let 2-3 tablets dissolve under your tongue (sublingual absorption through mucous membranes, bypassing digestion).
- **Where to buy:** Get the enlarged bottle packaging at 7-11 or Lawson. Confirm the first ingredient on the label is "ぶどう糖."
- **Effect:** Prefrontal cortex reboot within 10 minutes.

### Liquid Carbs

**Products:** Weider in Jelly (威德 in ゼリー) / Energy Jelly

- **Why:** Liquid digests faster than solid. The blue "Energy" jelly in Japanese convenience stores, or 100% grape juice / orange juice.
- **Note:** This is an "emergency kit." Drink it, effects in 15-20 minutes, can sustain about 45 minutes. **Must follow up with "sustained nutrition"**, otherwise blood sugar will crash even harder after the spike.

**Alternatives:**
- Glucose tablets (any pharmacy)
- 100% fruit juice (not "fruit drink")

## Part 2: Sustained Endurance — How to Avoid the "Blood Sugar Rollercoaster"?

If you only eat sugar, you'll fall into a vicious cycle of "excitement-crash-eat more sugar." You need **slow-release energy** to maintain hours of flow.

### The Formula

**Low GI carbs + Quality fats + Protein**

### Quality Fats (Brain's Protective Oil)

The brain is 60% fat. You need Omega-3 and MCT.

### Convenience Store Formulas (Japan)

#### Recovery Meal Combo
| Item | Japanese | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| Onsen tamago | 温泉卵 | Gentle protein, easy to digest |
| Salmon onigiri | 鮭おにぎり | Omega-3 + complex carbs |
| Mixed nuts | 無塩ミックスナッツ | Healthy fats for sustained energy (walnuts are best) |

#### Flow Maintenance Stack
| Item | Why |
|------|-----|
| 70%+ Dark chocolate | Theobromine + magnesium + flavonoids (increases cerebral blood flow) |
| Black coffee (small) | Adenosine blocker, but see **Caffeine Protocol** below |
| Banana | Potassium + quick carbs |

---

## Part 2.5: Caffeine Protocol — The 6-Hour Rule

> **Observation:** Headache appears ~6 hours after coffee. Eating immediately resolves it.

This is a predictable physiological pattern for high-RPM brains. Coffee doesn't cause the headache directly—it creates conditions that do.

### Why 6 Hours?

| Mechanism | What Happens | Why Eating Helps |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Reactive Hypoglycemia** | Caffeine releases stored glycogen + suppresses appetite → 6h later (half-life), blood sugar crashes | Food directly replenishes glucose |
| **Adenosine Rebound** | Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors + constricts blood vessels → when it wears off, vessels over-dilate, pressing on nerves | Eating redirects blood flow to digestion, relieving cerebral pressure |
| **Dehydration** | Coffee is diuretic + you forgot to drink water during flow → electrolyte loss | Food (especially salty) restores sodium and locks in water |

### The Fix

| Rule | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| **Never drink coffee on empty stomach** | Always pair with slow-release carbs (oatmeal, whole grain) or fats (nuts, cheese) |
| **Set 5.5-hour alarm** | Eat BEFORE the headache (glucose tablets, onigiri, anything) |
| **1 coffee = 1 water** | Mandatory hydration pairing |

**Pattern recognition:** If you got a headache, ask yourself—did you drink coffee ~6 hours ago on an empty stomach?

#### Avoid
| Item | Japanese | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| Sweet bread | 菓子パン | Blood sugar rollercoaster (high GI spike then crash) |
| Energy drinks | — | Crash harder later |
| Heavy fried foods | — | Diverts blood to digestion |

## Part 3: Hydration Strategy

**The problem:** Sometimes brain "stuttering" is simply due to mild dehydration. The brain is "made of water"—2% dehydration causes 20% attention decline.

**The key insight:** You won't drink unless you see it.

**Solutions:**
- Keep water bottle in direct line of sight on your desk
- Set phone reminders every 45 minutes
- Use clear bottles so you can see the water level
- **Drink when you see it**—don't wait until thirsty

**The math:** 2% dehydration = 20% cognitive decline

## Part 4: Long-Term Supplements (Optional)

| Supplement | Purpose | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Omega-3 (Fish oil) | Neuronal membrane health | 1-2g EPA+DHA daily |
| Magnesium | Nervous system calm | Glycinate form before bed |
| Creatine | Brain energy buffer | 3-5g daily |

*Consult a doctor before starting any supplement regimen.*

## Quick Reference Card

### Emergency (Brain Stalling)
```
Ramune (2-3 tablets, sublingual) → 10 min effect
    or
Weider in Jelly (Blue) → 15-20 min effect
    or
100% Juice → 15-20 min effect
```

### Sustained (Preventing Crash)
```
Before work: Salmon onigiri + nuts + water visible
During work: Dark chocolate + water every 45 min
After flow: Onsen tamago + complex carbs
```

### Avoid
```
Sweet bread, energy drinks, heavy fried foods
= Blood sugar rollercoaster = Harder crash
```
