# Nutrition Pack

> Fuel strategies for high-RPM brains. v1.0 (Tokyo Edition)

## Emergency Glucose

When your brain stalls, it needs monosaccharides NOW. Sucrose (table sugar) is too slow—it needs to be broken down first.

### The Ramune Hack

**Product:** Morinaga Large Ramune (森永大粒ラムネ)
- **Composition:** ~90% glucose (ブドウ糖)
- **Method:** Let 2-3 tablets dissolve under your tongue
- **Why sublingual:** Direct absorption through mucous membranes, bypassing digestion
- **Effect:** Prefrontal cortex reboot within 10 minutes

**Alternatives:**
- Glucose tablets (any pharmacy)
- Weider in Jelly (Blue Energy version)
- 100% fruit juice (not "fruit drink")

## Hydration Strategy

**The problem:** You won't drink unless you see it.

**Solutions:**
- Keep water bottle in direct line of sight
- Set phone reminders every 45 minutes
- Use clear bottles so you can see the water level

**The math:** 2% dehydration = 20% cognitive decline
