# Warning Signals

> Your personal "dashboard warning lights." Learn to read them before the engine blows.

For high-sensitivity / high-focus individuals, **the "tired" signal is usually delayed**. When you feel tired, you've actually already over-depleted. You need to capture **earlier, fainter signals**.

## Why Early Detection Matters

You can't drive a Ferrari by waiting for smoke to come out of the hood. By the time you feel "tired," you've already overdrafted your account. The self-attack spiral is about to begin.

**The goal:** Catch the warning lights while you can still safely pull over.

## Signal Categories

### 1. Cognitive Signals (The "Glitch")

These are your first warning lights—often appearing 30-60 minutes before emotional collapse.

| Signal | What It Looks Like | Severity |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **Reading comprehension failure** | You need to read the same line of code or sentence twice to understand it | 🟡 Warning |
| **Short-term memory loss** | Just switched a window, forgot what you were about to search | 🟡 Warning |
| **Low-level errors** | Making typos or grammar mistakes you would NEVER normally make | 🟠 Critical |

**Action:** Once ANY of these three appear, **stop immediately**. Continuing only produces garbage that needs to be redone.

### 2. Physiological Signals (The Physical Tells)

Your body knows before your mind does.

| Signal | What's Happening | Severity |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **Sighing** | Unconscious deep breaths (brain is oxygen-starved, trying to exchange gases through sighing) | 🟡 Warning |
| **Cold hands/feet** | Blood over-concentrated in the brain, extremities under-supplied | 🟡 Warning |
| **Tunnel vision** | Screen feels extremely glaring, or peripheral vision goes blurry | 🟠 Critical |
| **Physical tension** | Jaw clenched, shoulders raised, shallow breathing | 🟠 Critical |

### 3. Emotional Signals (The "Jerk" Factor)

These are the final warning before self-attack begins.

| Signal | What's Happening | Severity |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **Sudden irritability** | Something ordinary (like a webpage loading 1 second slow) suddenly makes you furious | 🔴 Error |
| **Micro-rage** | Disproportionate anger at tiny obstacles | 🔴 Error |
| **Sudden loneliness** | Wave of isolation or meaninglessness out of nowhere | 🔴 Error |

**This is the sign that the prefrontal cortex has lost control.**

## Response Protocol

| Severity | Signal Examples | Immediate Action |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| 🟡 **Warning** | Sighing, cold hands, re-reading lines | Note the time. You have ~30 min left. Start winding down. |
| 🟠 **Critical** | Memory gaps, tunnel vision, typos | **Stop input now.** Consume glucose. 5-minute break minimum. |
| 🔴 **Error** | Rage, sudden emptiness, first self-attacking thought | **Emergency shutdown.** No decisions. Execute [Emergency Manual](./emergency-manual.md). |

## The "Check Engine" Questions

Ask yourself these every 90 minutes:

1. **Can I read this line of code on the first try?**
2. **Are my hands warm?**
3. **When did I last drink water?**
4. **Am I sighing without noticing?**
5. **Did anything minor just annoy me disproportionately?**

If you answer "no" or "yes" to the wrong ones, it's pit stop time.

## Building Your Personal Warning System

Everyone's signals are slightly different. Use the [Debugging Log](./debugging-log.md) to track your episodes and identify YOUR specific early warnings.

Common patterns people discover:
- "My left eye starts twitching about 20 minutes before crash"
- "I start craving sweet coffee specifically"
- "I notice I'm holding my breath"
- "My typing speed drops noticeably"

## The Meta-Warning

**The most dangerous signal: "I'm fine, just 10 more minutes."**

When this thought appears, you're already past warning into critical. The prefrontal cortex is rationalizing its own shutdown.

**Rule:** If you catch yourself negotiating for "just a bit more time," that IS the signal.
