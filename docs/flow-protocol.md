# Flow Protocol

> How to ride the wave without wiping out. Operating procedures for Ferrari owners.

Since you know this is a high-performance but also high-fuel-consumption sports car, you can't drive it like a regular sedan (9-to-5, steady output).

---

## The Core Problem

You said you get "pulled into flow anytime, anywhere." This means your "brake pads" are worn out.

The so-called "being pulled in" is actually your brain's dopamine circuit being **hijacked** by an interesting problem. You didn't "choose" to enter—you "fell" in.

## Pre-Flow: Identifying the Entry Point

### Recognize "Pseudo-Flow" Traps

**Awareness:** When you find yourself outside work hours (walking, eating, before bed) suddenly starting to frantically think through a logical problem—**force the brake**.

**Mantra:** "This idea is great, but I'm out of fuel right now. I'll think about it tomorrow morning."

### Set Up Physical Blockers

Since you know you're prone to falling into the abyss, set up **physical interrupters**:

- Phone alarm every 90 minutes (non-negotiable)
- Water bottle in line of sight (drink when you see it)
- Snacks within arm's reach (glucose emergency kit)

## During Flow: The 90-Minute Rule

### Ultradian Rhythms

The human brain's high-frequency focus limit is approximately **90 minutes**. Set a 90-minute timer.

**Critical point:** When time's up, **even if you're writing the most brilliant line of code, stop.**

### Why This Works

This "unfinished feeling" actually makes it easier to pick up after rest (**Zeigarnik Effect**), while avoiding depletion.

### The Rule

```
90 minutes ON → 20 minutes OFF → Repeat
```

No exceptions. No "just 5 more minutes."

### During Break: Switch Brain Regions

Rest doesn't mean scrolling your phone. Phone use still consumes visual and logic brain regions.

**Do:**
- Look at distant objects (relax eye muscles)
- Do a few squats (draw blood from brain back to legs)
- Go pour a glass of water
- Step outside, feel the air

**Don't:**
- Check social media
- Read news
- "Quickly" check email
- Any screen time

---

## Soft Landing: Cool-Down Routine

**Don't go directly from 10,000 RPM to shutdown.** That's how engines blow (self-attack).

### 30 Minutes Before Stopping

Deliberately do some low-intensity wrap-up work:
- Organize files
- Backup data
- Write notes for tomorrow
- Clean your desk

Let brainwaves slowly descend.

### Must Eat Something

High-intensity brain use consumes glucose. A lot of the "self-loathing" is simply **low blood sugar**.

After ending flow, immediately intake some sugar or carbs.

### The Shutdown Ritual

Before completely "powering off," spend 10 minutes writing tomorrow's "startup checklist."

This tells your brain: **"Task saved. Safe to go offline now."**

Reduces post-work background subconscious anxiety.

---

## Post-Flow: The "Dead Zone"

### Accept Your Cyclical Nature

You probably can't sustain 8 hours of steady daily output. You're a **pulse worker**:

- Intense output for 4 hours (completing 2 days' worth of others' work)
- Then completely "crash" for 4 hours like a dead machine

**This IS your normal state.** Don't blame yourself for those 4 hours of "downtime"—that's when you're recharging.

### What to Do in the Dead Zone

- Don't try to be productive
- Don't review your work
- Don't make decisions
- Do: eat, rest, mechanical tasks, nothing

## The Complete Protocol

```
[Pre-Flow]
├── Physical blockers in place (timer, water, snacks)
├── Quick body scan: Am I already tired?
└── Intention: "I will stop at the 90-minute mark"

[During Flow: 90 min]
├── Deep work
├── Water visible, drink when seen
└── Timer is NON-NEGOTIABLE

[Break: 20 min]
├── No screens
├── Physical movement
├── Distant gazing
└── Glucose if needed

[Repeat or Wind Down]

[Cool-Down: 30 min]
├── Low-intensity tasks only
├── Organize, backup, notes
└── Eat something

[Shutdown Ritual: 10 min]
├── Write tomorrow's startup list
├── "Task saved"
└── Permission to go offline
```

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure | What Happens | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| "Just 5 more minutes" | 5 becomes 50, crash inevitable | Timer means STOP. Period. |
| Phone during break | No actual rest, just different drain | Phone goes in drawer during break |
| Skipping cool-down | 10,000 RPM → 0, engine blows | 30 min wind-down is mandatory |
| No shutdown ritual | Brain keeps running in background | Write the list. Every time. |
| Blaming yourself for dead zone | Adds emotional damage to physical | Dead zone = recharging. It's the deal. |

## Remember

You're not lazy during downtime. You're not broken for crashing. You're not weak for needing glucose.

You're a Ferrari. Ferraris need pit stops. That's the deal.
