# Theory Basis

> Why do our brains work this way? The science behind the "Ferrari engine" problem.

## The Ferrari Engine Model

You have a brain optimized for **pattern recognition** and **creative problem-solving**. This comes with architectural trade-offs.

### Low Latent Inhibition (LLI)

**Normal brain:** Filters out ~95% of sensory input as "irrelevant"
**Your brain:** Filters out much less, treating more stimuli as potentially meaningful

**Advantages:**
- See connections others miss
- Notice subtle patterns
- Creative leaps come naturally

**Costs:**
- Sensory overload in busy environments
- Difficulty "turning off"
- Higher baseline cognitive load

### The Involuntary Flow Problem

Normal flow state: Chosen → Enjoyable → Sustainable
Your flow state: Often involuntary → Compulsive → Depleting

This isn't "good focus"—it's **hyperfocus**, a form of attention capture where the brain's reward system hijacks executive control.

## The Dopamine Crash

### Why You Feel Terrible After Flow

During intense focus, your brain floods with dopamine. When you stop:

1. **Dopamine drops rapidly** (faster than it rose)
2. **Relative deficiency** makes baseline feel like depression
3. **Self-attack thoughts emerge** as the prefrontal cortex (impulse control) goes offline before the limbic system (emotions) calms down

**Key insight:** The negative thoughts are a **neurochemical artifact**, not accurate self-assessment.

### The Timeline

## Glucose and the Prefrontal Cortex

The prefrontal cortex (rational thinking, impulse control) is metabolically expensive. It's the first to fail when fuel runs low.

**Order of shutdown:**
1. Complex reasoning ↓
2. Reading comprehension ↓
3. Short-term memory ↓
4. Emotional regulation ↓ ← Self-attack happens here
5. Basic motor function (last to go)

**Why glucose works:** It's the brain's primary fuel. Direct glucose bypasses the slow process of breaking down complex carbs.

## The 90-Minute Rhythm

Humans operate on **ultradian rhythms**—90-minute cycles of higher and lower alertness.

**Natural pattern:**
- 90 min: High capacity
- 20 min: Natural dip (rest period)
- Repeat

**What we do:** Override the dip with caffeine/willpower, extending the high phase artificially.

**The cost:** The longer you extend, the harder the crash.
