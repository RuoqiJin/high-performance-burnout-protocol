# Emergency Manual

> A fool-proof guide for when you're in the middle of a self-attack spiral or extreme depletion.

When your brain has been running at high speed but your body is exhausted, and you can't simply "go to sleep" because your nervous system is still in excitation mode—you need **forced cooldown** and **mode switching**.

The following strategies are organized by "speed of effect" and "difficulty of operation." Choose the most accessible one for your current environment.

## 1. Physiological "Force Restart" (Fastest, within 10 minutes)

When the brain won't stop, directly interrupt the brain's circuits through bodily responses.

### NSDR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest) / Yoga Nidra

- **Principle:** Currently highly recommended in Silicon Valley and high-pressure industries. Through auditory guidance, you consciously scan each body part, letting brainwaves drop from high-frequency beta to relaxed alpha or even theta—without falling asleep.
- **Method:** Put on headphones, search "NSDR" or "Yoga Nidra" on video platforms, find a 10-20 minute audio, and follow along.
- **Effect:** 20 minutes of NSDR typically equals 3-4 hours of sleep recovery feeling.

### Diving Reflex

- **Principle:** Mammalian instinct. Cold water contacting the face forcibly activates the parasympathetic nervous system, lowering heart rate.
- **Method:** Splash cold water on your face, or apply an ice pack/ice towel to your eyes and cheekbones for 30 seconds. This physically "cools down" anxious emotions.
- **Why it works:** Cold water on the face triggers the vagus nerve, immediately shifting from fight-or-flight to rest-and-digest.

### Physiological Sigh (Two-Inhale, One-Exhale)

The fastest way to reduce cortisol.

**How to do it:**
1. Inhale deeply through your nose (first inhale, long)
2. At the top, take a second shorter inhale (to fully expand the lungs, like topping off)
3. Long, slow exhale through your mouth (like deflating a balloon, empty the lungs completely)

Repeat 5-10 times. This is scientifically proven to reduce stress faster than any other breathing technique.

## 2. Environment & Sensory Deprivation (1-2 hours)

Your brain has processed too much information (visual, auditory, decisions). Now you need to cut off input sources.

### Hot Bath / Onsen (Passive Heating)

- If you have access (at home or nearby facilities), soak in a hot bath or sauna. The passive rise and subsequent cooling of body temperature sends strong "sleep/rest" signals to the brain.
- In hot water, gravity sensation decreases, and physical tension is physically released.

### Darkness Therapy

- Close blackout curtains, put on an eye mask, just lie on the floor or sofa.
- Do nothing—don't even need to sleep.
- Simply "cutting off light input" can enormously relieve the load on the visual cortex (one of the brain's most energy-consuming regions).

## 3. Low Cognitive Load Mechanical Activities

If lying down makes you more anxious (overthinking), then let your **hands** move while your **brain** stops.

### Organizing & Cleaning
- Fold clothes, wash dishes, wipe tables.
- These actions are repetitive and mechanical, requiring no logical thinking, but bring small senses of "order" and "control" that counter the brain's current chaos.

### Repetitive Games or White Noise Videos
- Play no-brainer decompression games
- Watch hoof-trimming or carpet-cleaning videos
- These contents feature: immediate feedback, but no complex decisions required from you.

## 4. Cognitive Offloading

If self-attacking thoughts keep emerging:

### Brain Dump

1. Get a sheet of paper and a pen (avoid electronic devices to avoid blue light and notifications)
2. Write down every thought in your head, no matter how absurd, trivial, or negative
3. Don't "process the logic" in your brain—dump directly onto paper
4. **After writing, tell yourself:** "These issues have been recorded, won't be lost. I can temporarily not deal with them now."

## Cognitive Interrupt Mantras

When "I'm terrible" thoughts flood in, use these circuit breakers:

- **"This is physiological noise, not reality."**
- **"This is dopamine withdrawal, not truth."**
- **"My prefrontal cortex is offline. I will not make decisions now."**
- **"I felt invincible 3 hours ago. The only thing that changed is blood sugar."**
- **"This is the brain lacking sugar / lacking sleep. This is a physiological response, not me thinking."**

### How to Respond

1. **Don't argue:** Don't try to use logic to refute those self-attacking thoughts. Right now, the rational brain can't beat the emotional brain—arguing only exhausts you more.
2. **Label it:** Tell yourself: "This is the brain lacking sugar / lacking sleep. This is a physiological response, not me thinking."
3. **Physical reboot:** At this point, psychological adjustment is often ineffective. **Physiological adjustment** works best.

## The 10-Minute Rule

When crashing:
1. Set a timer for 10 minutes
2. Do NOTHING productive
3. Consume glucose (Ramune, juice)
4. Lie down if possible

After 10 minutes, reassess. Usually the storm has passed.

## What NOT To Do

**Right now, absolutely DO NOT:**

- ❌ **Review your work:** Current review will only be distorted by negative emotions into a self-criticism rally
- ❌ **Make major decisions:** Risk assessment ability is miscalibrated in fatigued states
- ❌ Plan your life
- ❌ Text anyone about how you're feeling
- ❌ Open social media

These activities require a functioning prefrontal cortex. Yours is temporarily offline.

## Physical Reboot Options

When psychological adjustment fails, go physical:

- Eat some carbs or sweets (supply energy to the prefrontal cortex)
- Take a hot shower (parasympathetic nerve relaxation)
- Or just sleep directly
