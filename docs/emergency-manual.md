## Physiological Sigh (Two-Inhale, One-Exhale)

The fastest way to activate your parasympathetic nervous system.

**How to do it:**
1. Inhale deeply through your nose
2. At the top, take a second shorter inhale (to fully expand the lungs)
3. Long, slow exhale through your mouth

Repeat 3-5 times. This is scientifically proven to reduce stress faster than any other breathing technique.

## Diving Reflex (Cold Water Reset)

Activates the mammalian diving reflex, forcing your heart rate down.

**Options:**
- Splash ice-cold water on your face
- Press an ice pack or cold towel against your closed eyes
- Hold your breath while doing this for maximum effect

**Why it works:** Cold water on the face triggers the vagus nerve, immediately shifting you from fight-or-flight to rest-and-digest.

## Cognitive Interrupt Mantras

When "I'm terrible" thoughts flood in, use these circuit breakers:

- **"This is physiological noise, not reality."**
- **"This is dopamine withdrawal, not truth."**
- **"My prefrontal cortex is offline. I will not make decisions now."**
- **"I felt invincible 3 hours ago. The only thing that changed is blood sugar."**

## The 10-Minute Rule

When crashing:
1. Set a timer for 10 minutes
2. Do NOTHING productive
3. Consume glucose (Ramune, juice)
4. Lie down if possible

After 10 minutes, reassess. Usually the storm has passed.

## What NOT To Do

- ❌ Review your work
- ❌ Plan your life
- ❌ Make any decisions
- ❌ Text anyone about how you're feeling
- ❌ Open social media

These activities require a functioning prefrontal cortex. Yours is temporarily offline.
